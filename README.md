# High School programming

## FUTURE PLANS FOR THIS REPOSITORY: the source files, along with any other additional files will be compacted into a singular zip in order to organize this repository better. 

##### NOTE: Many of the files here are in .fla and .swf format and thusly are incredbily difficult to run unless you have the Adobe Flash program installed on your computer.

Many of the files here are very rough builds and **cannot be guaranteed to work as expected** and only serve to highlight the creative process in game development plus act as a cloud storage for files in the event of my own personal hardware failure.

Lastly, the files and programs in this directory will no longer be updated by their original programmers(Myself and Caleb Pagel) and should be considered 100% complete.
